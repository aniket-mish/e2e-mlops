# Discovery

## Design
I'm building an ML service that discovers biomedical content and categorizes it. The motivation behind this side project is to learn about distributed ML patterns, MLOps, and LLMs.

### Setup

Now to do distributed ml, I need to have a cluster/group of machines so that I can effortlessly scale the workloads. I'm using Ray here.
